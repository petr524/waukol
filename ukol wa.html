<h2>FIRST CS2 MATCHES TO BE FEATURED DURING ESL CHALLENGER JÖNKÖPING QUALIFIERS</h2>
<p>The European open qualifier is set to begin on Tuesday and will be featured on HLTV from the round of 16 onwards.</p>

<p>ESL recently announced that it will be moving its competitions to Counter-Strike 2, and the two ESL Challenger Jönköping regional qualifiers are the first to be held in the new game. CS2 is currently without a coaching feature, so the rules written on the FACEIT website state that coaching is not allowed at the event.</p>

<p>Almost 200 teams have already signed up for the event in the European qualifier, where four Closed Qualifier spots are available. Some of the biggest names on the team list include TSM, Aurora, and Bad News Eagles. The bracket will be drawn before the action commences at 18:00 , with several community streams in different languages set to accompany the opening rounds.</p>
